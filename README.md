### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Experienced coder. A person not afraid of math and statistics. Someone who is able to implement design through various programming languages. All these descriptions can go for a good front-end developer. However, who really is this software professional whose work we can see literally everywhere on the Internet and without whom we would not be able to enjoy our favorite websites the way we do? It is someone with extensive knowledge of technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Someone who gives you (a user) the opportunity to interact with the website and website applications directly. Finally, someone that makes sure you can open up and browse the site on any device or in any browser and the information will still be relevant and easy to read.
